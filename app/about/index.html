          <p>With 15+ years experience working in corporate marketing, we've hired our fair share of agencies and freeelancers.</p>

          <h4>It Wasn't Always Great</h4>
          <p>In many instances, hiring and working with agencies and freelancers was positive. But, a good number of times we found agency costs to be exorbitant for the quality of the product, as well as freelancer timelines and project management to be lacking.</p>

          <h4>So, We Made Something Better</h4>
          <p>What if we combined the best parts of working with agencies (project management, clear timelines, responsiveness) with the best parts of working with freelancers (cost effectiveness, flexibility, and direct communication)? Well, we thought that would be great. So, we made <strong>And Also Agency</strong>.</p>
